"Hi kid! Are you drawing a bird?  

I can't see exactly what you're drawing in the image,  but there are some clues that make me think it might be a bird.  The white space at the top could be the bird's head, and the marks below could be its wings or tail.",N/A,"Is that a bird you're drawing?  The top part could be the head, and the lines below could be the wings or tail.  Cool!

"In this session, we had a conversation about what you might be drawing. I guessed that you were drawing a bird based on the limited information I have about your age and the potential clues in the image you might be creating.  We also discussed the challenges of accurately guessing a drawing without seeing it. ",N/A,"We talked about your drawing! It's hard to know for sure what it is without seeing it all, but maybe it's a bird?"
